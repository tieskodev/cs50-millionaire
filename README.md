# CS50 Millionaire 🎮💰

**CS50 Millionaire** is a quiz game inspired by the Brazilian TV show **“Show do Milhão”**, which itself is a localized version of the famous show *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*.  
This project was developed in **Scratch** as part of **CS50 (2026), Harvard University**.

## 📌 About the Project

I created this game to practice programming logic using Scratch’s limited resources, but without treating it as a “simple” or disposable assignment.  
My goal was to build a **fully functional, complete game**, from start to finish — one that feels polished, visually pleasant, and reminiscent of the classic *Show do Milhão* that aired on Brazilian television.

Rather than just meeting the minimum requirements, I challenged myself to design a real game experience, applying concepts such as **project scalability**, **code refactoring**, and **basic game design**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout the development process, I focused on:
- Writing **clean, organized, and understandable code**
- Structuring the project so it could be **improved or expanded in the future**
- Balancing functionality with Scratch’s inherent limitations

The code is not perfectly optimized or minimalistic, and that was intentional. Given the limited timeframe, clarity and completion were prioritized over perfection.

## ⏱️ Development Time & Scope

This project was completed within a **5-day time window**.  
While there are many possible improvements — such as additional screens, menus, animations, or more questions — the goal was to fully finish the game within a realistic and limited schedule.

Despite the time constraints, the learning experience was extremely valuable, and finishing a complete project was deeply rewarding (even if it leaves that constant itch to keep improving it forever!).

## 🎯 Gameplay Overview

In **CS50 Millionaire**, the player must answer **10 multiple-choice questions** to reach the **$1,000,000 grand prize**.

### Rules & Mechanics:
- Each question has **four possible answers**, but only **one is correct**
- For each level, one of several possible questions is selected
- The game is played using the **mouse**

### Lifelines:
- 🟡 **Skip Question**  
  You may skip **one question** during the game (except for the final three).  
  Skipping replaces the question but **does not advance your level** or grant any reward.

- 🃏 **Card Draw Help**  
  You may draw cards **once** during the game (except for the final three).  
  **Tip:** The suit does not matter — only the number  
  *(Ace = 1st option is correct, 2 = 2nd option, etc.)*

Use your resources wisely to reach the final prize!

## 🌍 Motivation

This project was inspired by *Show do Milhão*, the Brazilian version of *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*.  
I developed it as a way to put into practice everything I’ve learned throughout CS50 so far.

It has been an incredible journey, and I hope players have as much fun playing this game as I had building it.

## 📚 Technologies Used

- Scratch (MIT)
- Concepts from CS50: logic, control flow, abstraction, and basic game design

## 🏁 Final Notes

This project represents both a technical and personal milestone.  
It may not be perfect, but it is **complete**, **functional**, and built with care — and that, by itself, makes it a success.

Good luck, contestant! 🍀
